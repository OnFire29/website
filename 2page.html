       <h1 id="language">WHAT AM I DOING IN MY LIFE?</h1>
       <p id="doing">
           Since I was a kid I liked techology and that brought me <br>
           where I'am right now, studying at the high school Max Planck, <br>
           that's not all, because during my life i founded the needing to interact <br>
           with the world out of Italy, so to learn english, as skill level of english <br>
           I'm feeling good but I'm still learning it, but slowly, I have lots of friends <br>
           all around the world, infact that's an advantage that i have to learn this beatiful language.
